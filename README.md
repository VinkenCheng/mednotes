# MedNotes
A simple server for browsing notebooks created with [Quiver](http://happenapps.com/#quiver).

#### Why?
I use this to quickly view all of my Quiver notes from mobile devices.

#### Workflow
1. Take notes with [Quiver](http://happenapps.com/#quiver)
2. Export a notebook as HTML to the `mednotes/notebooks/` directory
3. Push the changes to the server
